# Password Storage

In this session we’ll discuss methods of securely storing passwords and what to watch out for.

## What you’ll learn

  * Use Bcrypt (or Scrypt)
  * Goals for password security
  * Never use a bare hash (e.g. MD5, SHA1) 
    * They’re too fast
  * If you can’t use those, use PBKDF2 and slow it way down
