Sample pentest report provided by TCM Security

### Notes

I am frequently asked what an actual pentest report looks like.  I am providing a barebones demo report for "demo company" that consisted of an external penetration test.  The report only includes one finding and is meant to be a starter template for others to use.  Please feel free to download and make this your own.

Happy hacking!
